<p>The selection of a Third-Party or intermediary purchaser to acquire your personal information may be determined by a
    comparison with available products/services, including solar and/or home improvement-related products/services. The
    position of each potential purchaser may also be determined primarily by the price the purchaser is willing to pay
    for the information (e.g., the higher the price, the better the purchaser's position).</p>
<p>We do not knowingly sell the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.</p>
<h3>5. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the following rights under applicable California law in relation to your
    personal information, subject to certain exceptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Right to Know</strong>. You have the right to, up to twice in a 12-month period, request what personal
        information we collect, use, disclose, and/or sell, as applicable.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Right to Delete</strong>. You have the right to request under certain circumstances the deletion of your
        personal information that is collected by us.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale</strong>. You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal
        information by a business.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination</strong>. You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the
        exercise of the privacy rights described above.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to submit a request.</strong> You may exercise any of the rights described in this section by accessing
    our <a href="/ccpa-opt-out.php">webform</a> or by emailing us at <strong><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fd94939b92d68e92919c8fd09092939884d08e9c8b988fd39e9290bd8e909c8f898e92919c8f8e9c8b94939a8ed39e9290">[email&#160;protected]</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (“<strong>Verifiable
        Consumer Request</strong>”) as permitted by the CCPA. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided
    sufficient information that enables us to reasonably verify that you are the consumer about whom we collected the
    personal information on. In order to verify you, you must provide us with your first and last name, email address,
    and physical address. These rights are also subject to various exclusions and exceptions under applicable laws.</p>
<p>You may also designate an authorized agent, in writing or through a power of attorney, to request to exercise the
    above rights on your behalf. The authorized agent may submit a request to exercise these rights by emailing the
    letter of authorization or power of attorney to <strong><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="40292e262f6b332f2c21326d2d2f2e25396d33213625326e232f2d00332d213234332f2c2132332136292e27336e232f2d">[email&#160;protected]</a></strong>.</p>
<p>We currently do not collect household data. If we receive a Right to Know or Right to Delete request submitted by all
    members of a household, we will individually respond to each request. We will not be able to comply with any request
    by a member of a household under the age of 13, as we do not collect personal information from any person under the
    age of 13.</p>
<p>We will respond to your request within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a Verifiable Consumer Request for a
    period covering twelve (12) months and for no more than twice in a twelve-month period. Lead Flux reserves the right
    to extend the response time by an additional forty-five (45) days when reasonably necessary and provided consumer
    notification of the extension is made within the first forty-five (45) days.</p>
<p><strong>Direct marketing by third parties.</strong> Lead Flux discloses personal information to third parties for
    their own direct marketing purposes. California residents have the right to request information regarding such
    practices under California’s “Shine the Light” law. If you are a California resident and would like to inquire
